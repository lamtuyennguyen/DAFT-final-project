## Project Description

For many people, including myself, the primary goal in life is to be happy. But what makes people happy? What factors or attributes could contribute to, or at least are correlated to happiness?
In an attempt to answer this question, I collected various indices and run regression against the happiness score of the World Happiness Report. Doing so, I can find out how much each selected index is correlated to the happiness score and whether the model is statistically significant.

Indices I gathered to examine potential correlation to the happiness score:

- Quality of Life Index
- Purchasing Power Index
- Safety Index
- Health Care Index
- Traffic Commute Time Index
- Pollution Index
- Climate Index
- Cost of Living Plus Rent Index
- Passport Index 
- Ease of Doing Business Index
- Corruption Index
- Population Density
- Current Covid Cases
